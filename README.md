## audiobook webscraper
### Why?
I created this to automate the retrieval of download links from this [site](https://azkabanaudiobook.com/). If you don't have an ad blocker when visiting that site then you have been warned that there is a lot of popups.
### How?
My original idea was to automate the mouse using pyautogui to retrieve a list of links. I soon discovered that this was much harder, as the pop up ads were different every time. Next I decided to use requests and BeautifulSoup. I will add more comments on the audiobook_webscraper.py file so you can see exactly how I made it.
### When?
I created the web scraper in about a week. And I am continually putting work into the Flask site.
## More projects coming soon
